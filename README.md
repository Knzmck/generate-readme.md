   ## About   

   This software uses node.js and will include: title, motivation, description, installation instructions, usage, license badge, contributing, test images & developer information to direct your questions to.   

   In a seemingly endless sea of open-source software on github a great README file helps any project stand out. This README.md generator makes adding a readme to your repository quicker and easier than ever before. You can make your whole markdown file within minutes or just get the bare-bones of the formatting and go back to edit later.   

   ## Installation   

   NPM is required to use this software as well as a github account.  

   ## Usage  

   To use this software you need visual studio code (or a similar program), NPM and a github account.  
    Once NPM files are installed with your code, run node index.js on the command bar. You will be prompted with a series of questions about the content of your README.md file. Once you've answered all of the questions a markdown file will automatically generate which you can use for any repository.
